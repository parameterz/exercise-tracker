Back-friendly rowing movement using resistance bands. Great alternative to bent-over rows.

## Instructions
1. Anchor band at waist height or wrap around sturdy post
2. Hold handles, step back to create tension
3. Start with arms extended, slight lean back
4. Keep chest up, core engaged
5. Pull handles to sides of torso
6. Squeeze shoulder blades together
7. Return to start with control

## Key Points
- Can sit or stand (sitting may be easier)
- Focus on pulling with back, not just arms
- Keep elbows close to body as you pull
- Don't let shoulders round forward
- Control the return - don't let band snap back

## Benefits
- Easier on lower back than bent-over rows
- Great for building back strength
- Can adjust resistance by stepping closer/farther
- Joint-friendly

## Variations
- **Seated Row**: Sit on floor, wrap band around feet
- **High Row**: Anchor band higher for different angle
- **Single-Arm Row**: Work one side at a time

## Perfect For
- Building back strength without heavy weights
- When traveling (pack a band!)
- Anyone with lower back concerns

Powerful hip hinge movement that builds explosive strength and cardio endurance.

## Instructions
1. Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, kettlebell on ground between feet
2. Hinge at hips (not squat), grab kettlebell with both hands
3. Hike the kettlebell back between legs
4. Drive hips forward explosively, swing kettlebell to chest/shoulder height
5. Let momentum carry it - don't lift with arms
6. Control descent and repeat

## Key Points
- **This is a HIP movement, not a squat or arm lift**
- Power comes from explosive hip extension
- Keep arms relaxed - they're just ropes
- Kettlebell shouldn't go higher than shoulders
- Core stays braced throughout

## Common Mistakes
- Squatting instead of hinging
- Using arms to lift instead of hips to swing
- Rounding the back
- Going too heavy too soon

## Progression
- Start with 25lb kettlebell
- Master form before adding weight
- Build up to 15-20 reps for cardio conditioning

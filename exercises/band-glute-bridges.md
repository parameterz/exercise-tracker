## Instructions
1. Lie on back, knees bent, feet flat on floor
2. Place resistance band just above knees
3. Feet hip-width apart
4. Push knees out against band resistance
5. Drive through heels, lift hips up
6. Squeeze glutes hard at top
7. Lower with control

## Key Points
- Band creates extra glute activation
- Push knees OUT against band throughout
- Don't let knees cave in
- Squeeze glutes at top for 1-2 seconds
- Shoulders and upper back stay on floor
- Don't hyperextend lower back

## Benefits
- Activates often-weak glute muscles
- Great warm-up before squats/deadlifts
- Helps with hip stability
- Can help with lower back pain
- Improves posture

## Form Cues
- "Drive through heels"
- "Knees push out against band"
- "Make a straight line from knees to shoulders"

## Progression

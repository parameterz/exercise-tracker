Builds strong, healthy shoulders. Can be done seated or standing.

## Instructions
1. Start with dumbbells at shoulder height, palms forward
2. Elbows slightly in front of body (not directly out to sides)
3. Press dumbbells overhead until arms are straight
4. Don't let dumbbells touch at top
5. Lower with control back to shoulders

## Key Points
- Can do seated (easier, more stable) or standing
- Keep core engaged to protect lower back
- Don't arch back excessively when pressing
- Press slightly forward, ending dumbbells over ears
- Exhale as you press up

## Form Cues
- "Show someone your biceps" at bottom position
- "Make an arrow, not a T" - elbows slightly forward
- "Reach for the ceiling" at top

## Seated vs Standing
- **Seated**: More stable, easier to maintain form
- **Standing**: More core engagement, functional
- Start seated if new to the movement

## Start Weight
- 20lb dumbbells for most
- Focus on 8-10 good reps with control

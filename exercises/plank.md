Fundamental core stability exercise. Builds strength without spinal movement.

## Instructions
1. Start on forearms and toes (or knees if needed)
2. Elbows directly under shoulders
3. Body forms straight line from head to heels
4. Engage core by pulling belly button toward spine
5. Squeeze glutes
6. Hold position for prescribed time
7. Breathe normally - don't hold breath

## Key Points
- **Don't let hips sag** - most common mistake
- Don't pike hips up in air either
- Keep neck neutral - look at floor between hands
- Shoulders stay packed (don't let them hunch to ears)
- Quality over duration - stop if form breaks

## Modifications
- **Easier**: Plank on knees instead of toes
- **Easier**: Elevate hands on bench/wall
- **Harder**: Single-leg plank
- **Harder**: Add shoulder taps

## Progression
- Start with 15-20 seconds
- Add 5 seconds per week
- Goal: 45-60 seconds with perfect form
- Once easy, try variations instead of longer holds

## Common Mistakes
- Holding breath
- Hips too low (sagging back)
- Hips too high (mountain shape)
- Head dropping or looking forward

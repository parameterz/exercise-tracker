Essential pulling movement that builds back strength and improves posture.

## Instructions
1. Place right hand and knee on bench/chair for support
2. Left foot on ground, torso parallel to floor
3. Hold 20lb dumbbell in left hand, arm hanging straight
4. Pull dumbbell to hip, driving elbow back
5. Squeeze shoulder blade back at top
6. Lower with control
7. Complete reps, then switch sides

## Key Points
- Think "elbow to hip" not "hand to chest"
- Minimize torso rotation - keep stable
- Squeeze shoulder blade at top of movement
- Don't let shoulder round forward at bottom
- Back stays flat throughout

## Common Mistakes
- Rotating torso instead of pulling with back
- Using too much momentum
- Not bringing elbow high enough
- Shrugging shoulder up to ear

## Easier Option
- If no bench, can do bent-over two-arm rows
- Or support hand on sturdy surface

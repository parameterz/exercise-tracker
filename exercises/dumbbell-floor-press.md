Upper body pressing movement done lying on the floor. Safer for shoulders than bench press.

## Instructions
1. Lie on back on floor with knees bent, feet flat
2. Hold 20lb dumbbells with arms extended above chest
3. Lower dumbbells slowly until elbows touch floor
4. Brief pause with elbows on floor
5. Press dumbbells back up to start position
6. Don't let dumbbells touch at top

## Key Points
- Floor limits range of motion - great for shoulder safety
- Triceps rest on floor briefly at bottom
- Press straight up, not toward each other
- Keep shoulder blades pulled back and down
- Core engaged, don't arch lower back excessively

## Benefits
- Builds chest, shoulders, and triceps
- Limited range protects shoulders
- Can do at home without bench
- Good for learning pressing pattern

## Progression
- Start with 20lb dumbbells
- Focus on control and full range
- Can progress to 25lbs or more reps

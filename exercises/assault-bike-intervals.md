Classic interval training for fat loss and conditioning. More intense than steady state.

## The Workout
- **Warm-up**: 3-5 minutes easy pace
- **Work Intervals**: 8 rounds of:
  - 20 seconds **HARD** effort
  - 40 seconds easy recovery
- **Cool-down**: 2-3 minutes easy pace

## What "Hard" Means
- **RPE 8-9 out of 10**
- Breathing heavily, can't talk in sentences
- Sustainable for 20 seconds but challenging
- Not all-out sprint, but definitely working

## Benefits
- Superior fat burning vs steady cardio
- Builds conditioning quickly
- Time-efficient (under 15 minutes total)
- Preserves muscle better than long cardio

## Progression
- **Week 1-2**: 6 rounds
- **Week 3-4**: 8 rounds  
- **Week 5-6**: 10 rounds
- **Advanced**: Increase work time to 30 seconds

## Tips
- Start conservative on first round
- Maintain consistent effort across all rounds
- Focus on breathing during rest periods
- Push AND pull with arms during work intervals

## Recovery
- Take 1-2 days between interval sessions
- Not for every workout - 2-3x per week max

Foundational strength movement that builds posterior chain (back, glutes, hamstrings).

## Instructions
1. Stand with feet hip-width apart, kettlebells beside feet
2. Hinge at hips, bend knees slightly, grab kettlebells
3. Keep chest proud, back flat, core tight
4. Drive through heels, extend hips and knees to stand
5. Squeeze glutes at top
6. Lower with control by hinging at hips

## Key Points
- Start with 25lb kettlebells (one in each hand)
- Keep kettlebells close to legs throughout movement
- Weight should be in heels, not toes
- Back stays neutral (not rounded)
- Lead with chest coming up

## Form Cues
- "Proud chest" - keep sternum lifted
- "Push floor away" - think of pushing through heels
- "Hinge, don't squat" - movement is hip-dominant

## Progression
- Master form with 20lb dumbbells first
- Progress to 25lb kettlebells
- Can increase reps before adding weight

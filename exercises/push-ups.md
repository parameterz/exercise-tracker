Classic upper body pressing movement. Builds strength and endurance.

## Instructions
1. Start in plank position, hands slightly wider than shoulders
2. Keep body in straight line from head to heels
3. Lower chest toward ground by bending elbows
4. Elbows track back at roughly 45-degree angle (not straight out)
5. Lower until chest nearly touches floor
6. Press back up to start position
7. Keep core engaged throughout

## Key Points
- Maintain plank position - don't let hips sag
- Full range of motion is important
- Control the descent
- Breathe: inhale down, exhale up
- Quality reps over quantity

## Modifications (Easiest to Hardest)
1. **Wall Push-Ups**: Hands on wall, body at angle
2. **Elevated Push-Ups**: Hands on bench/counter
3. **Knee Push-Ups**: On knees instead of toes
4. **Regular Push-Ups**: Full plank position
5. **Feet-Elevated Push-Ups**: Feet on bench

## Progression Path
- Start with easiest version you can do 8-10 good reps
- When you can do 15 reps, move to next harder version
- Goal: 10-15 regular push-ups from floor

## Common Mistakes
- Elbows flaring straight out to sides
- Hips sagging (losing plank position)
- Not going low enough
- Head dropping or jutting forward
- Using momentum/bouncing

## Perfect for 60+
- Start with wall or counter push-ups
- Progress gradually over weeks/months
- Focus on form and control
- No shame in using modifications

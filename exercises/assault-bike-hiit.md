High-Intensity Interval Training. Maximum fat burning and conditioning in minimal time.

## The Workout
- **Warm-up**: 5 minutes gradually building intensity
- **Work Intervals**: 10 rounds of:
  - 30 seconds **VERY HARD** effort
  - 30 seconds easy recovery
- **Cool-down**: 5 minutes easy pace

## What "Very Hard" Means
- **RPE 9-10 out of 10**
- Maximum sustainable effort
- Can barely speak during work interval
- Heart rate very elevated
- Should feel challenging but doable

## Benefits
- Maximum calorie burn per minute
- Significant EPOC (afterburn effect)
- Builds mental toughness
- Excellent for breaking plateaus

## When to Use
- Once you're comfortable with regular intervals
- 1-2x per week maximum
- Not on same days as heavy strength training
- Best when well-rested

## Progression
Start easier and build up:
- **Beginner HIIT**: 6 rounds, 20s work / 40s rest
- **Intermediate**: 8 rounds, 30s work / 30s rest
- **Advanced**: 10 rounds, 30s work / 30s rest
- **Beast Mode**: 12 rounds or 40s work / 20s rest

## Important Notes
- This is HARD - respect the intensity
- Quality over quantity
- If form breaks down, stop
- Requires good aerobic base first
- Not suitable for daily use

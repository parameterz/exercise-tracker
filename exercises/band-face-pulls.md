Excellent for shoulder health and posture. One of the best exercises for upper back.

## Instructions
1. Anchor band at face height (door anchor or sturdy point)

4. Pull band toward face, elbows high and wide
5. Pull hands to sides of face (near ears)
6. Squeeze shoulder blades together
7. Return to start with control

## Key Points

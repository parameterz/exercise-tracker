                                        <li>• Maintain 10-14k steps daily - this is your foundation!</li>
                                        <li>• Focus on form over weight, especially at 60</li>
                                        <li>• Rest days are crucial for recovery and progress</li>
                                        <li>• Combine with calorie deficit for weight loss (nutrition is 80% of results!)</li>
                                        <li>• Elastic bands add warm-ups, mobility, and joint-friendly exercises</li>
                                        <li>• If anything hurts (not just burns), stop and reassess</li>
